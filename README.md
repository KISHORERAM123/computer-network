This is my first Computer network design which I have done in cisco packet Tracer Version 6.2.0.0052. Packet Tracer is a simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies.It allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches.Hope you will find network design project useful.
